Mike is a published author with over a dozen titles to his name, all of them on topics linked to the 18th Century. These include social history titles – based on what everyday life was like for the ordinary ‘man in the street’ and including a look at memorable women and their achievements. Other titles cover Georgian inventors, and an under-the-bedclothes look at what royalty and aristocrats got up to in their private lives. He has written books with maritime themes – on castaways and on piracy. When not writing he blogs and gives talks about aspects of living in the 18th Century, with lectures in the UK, in Spain and in the United States. He has lectured on cruise ships in the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean and in the China Seas and is keen to develop his interest in all-things-Georgian.
